A cb7 thumbnail plugin for the K Desktop Environment (KDE 4).
Licensed under GPL, v3.

  Uses the KDE4's KIO::ThumbCreator class to add a service
  that provides previews for cb7 files (.cb7).

  See INSTALL for information on installing the plugin.

USAGE
=====

  To see it in action, open Dolphin and set the previews to on. Or hover
  over a .cb7 file to see the preview in the Information panel.

  If you want to turn on/off the previews for comic books, go to
  "Dolphin > Settings > Configure Dolphin... > General > Previews"
  and check/uncheck the "Comic Books (cb7)" plugin in it.

NOTES
=====
  * In some cases, you have to increase the Maximum File Size
    limit (~40 MB) in the configuration dialog to make certain previews work.
  * 7zl is part of program. 7zl must be installed in system - 
    without this, library will be not work
